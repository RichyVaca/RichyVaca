I'am a Computer Engineer with a great desire to learn and update myself in my area every day. I am a very patient person, tolerant, who likes to work in a team, I learn easily when I put them into practice, I adapt easily to different environments and I am easy to express my ideas and thoughts at the time, I really enjoy learn javascript or any technology that pleases me. I am still learning on frameworks like a React and React Native for mobile and my goal is become an excellent developer.

```javascript
const richie = {
    code: [Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS],
    tools: [React, React Native, NPM, bootstrap ],
    architecture: ["Web and mobile developer"],
    education:{
        school: "Insituto Tecnologico de Colima",
        degree: "Ingenieria Informatica",
        period: "AUGUST 2016 - JANUARY 2022"
    },
    challenge: "I will turn on all about from the tools React and React Native to specialize in this area"
}

```
