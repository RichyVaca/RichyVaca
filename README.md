<img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/3ov9jYwAZJOhd12jgQ/200w.webp" width="40" height="40" /> I'am a Computer Engineer with a great desire to learn and update myself in my area every day. I am a very patient person, tolerant, who likes to work in a team, I learn easily when I put them into practice, I adapt easily to different environments and I am easy to express my ideas and thoughts at the time, I really enjoy learn javascript or any technology that pleases me. I am still learning on frameworks like a React and React Native for mobile and my goal is become an excellent developer. <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/LPkczVwUYcMbXsRCdP/200w.webp" width="20" height="20" />
